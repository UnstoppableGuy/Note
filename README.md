1. Create 'Notes' application. (see Google Keep for reference).
2. App should show a list or a grid of created notes depending on screen orientation (list for portrait and grid for landscape).
3. Each note should consist of title, body and tag list. Title may not be empty. If user left it out empty, a current date should be used instead. Tag list may be empty.
4. List or grid may be sorted by date or note title. User can also browse notes by particular tag.
5. Any data storage option may be used. Note list should be persisted across app launches.
